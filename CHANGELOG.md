# Changelog

## [0.7.0]

### Added

- Workspace-wide semantic validation with cross-file symbol indexes (byName, byParent, byQualifiedName, definitionsByName, portsByName)
- Three new validation rules: redefinition multiplicity, port type compatibility, constraint body references
- Quick-fix code actions for all three new rules (align multiplicity, switch port endpoint, suggest nearest member)
- Context-aware completions: port endpoints in `connect` blocks, type annotation filtering, workspace definition symbols
- Semantic feedback in hover tooltips — shows diagnostics and repair hints at the hovered position
- Cached semantic diagnostics per document version to avoid redundant revalidation
- MCP preview tool falls back to cached/loaded documents when `code` parameter is omitted

### Changed

- Unused-definition rule narrowed to PartDef/ActionDef, excludes types with base types, promoted from Hint to Warning, now workspace-scoped
- Grammar updated to OMG "2026-02 - SysML v2 Release" — removed local `end <keyword>` patch in favour of upstream `endFeatureUsage` rule
- MCP non-visual tools annotated with explicit "NOT Visualization" routing guidance
- MCP preview response stripped to minimal render data (mermaidMarkup + title)
- MCP tool routing guidance and aliases expanded for diagnostics, validation, and file-focused preview requests

### Fixed

- Semantic validator signal quality: reduced specialization false positives and downgraded low-value unused-definition reports to warnings
- Document-close diagnostics race: pending validation timers are cancelled and diagnostics publishing is guarded for closed documents

## [0.6.0]

### Added

- Shared utilities: `identUtils.ts` for identifier handling, `symbolKindMapping.ts` for LSP SymbolKind mapping
- Keywords now derived from ANTLR grammar at runtime — no manual list to maintain
- Grammar support for `end` keyword syntax in interface/connection definitions
- DFA snapshot infrastructure for parser serialisation

### Changed

- Code actions use structured diagnostic data instead of message parsing
- Semantic tokens provider integrates lexer token types for operators/punctuation
- Library indexing supports qualified name resolution
- Parser retries with cleared DFA on error
- Refactored providers to use shared utility modules

### Removed

- Hand-maintained keyword list (replaced by grammar-derived extraction)

## [0.5.1]

### Changed

- Semantic validator: library type and feature reference checks
- Symbol table: improved keyword and redefinition pattern handling

## [0.5.0]

## [0.4.0]

## [0.3.1]

### Fixed

- esbuild: added `keepNames` for debugging

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- Mermaid diagram preview with 6 diagram types, focus mode, and diff mode
- Complexity analyser: structural metrics with composite 0–100 index
- Semantic validator: unresolved types, invalid multiplicity, duplicate definitions
- MCP tools: `preview`, `getDiagnostics`, `getComplexity`
- Code action quick-fixes: naming conventions, doc stubs, empty enum placeholders
- Library type-level indexing with Go-to-Definition into standard library
- Multiplicity and documentation extraction from parse tree
- LSP `sysml/serverStats`, `sysml/clearCache`, `sysml/status` requests

### Changed

- MCP `validate` response: `syntaxErrors` + `semanticIssues` (was `errors` + `errorCount`)
- Symbol `typeName` → `typeNames` (array)
- Diagnostics computed synchronously (removed background worker)
- Parser simplified to single-pass (removed SLL/LL fallback)
- esbuild output changed from ESM to CJS

### Removed

- Background parse worker thread and DFA warm-up
- Text-scanning reference finder (replaced by symbol-table lookups)

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- MCP server (`sysml-mcp` CLI): 7 tools, 3 resources, 3 prompts
- Standard library: 94 bundled SysML v2 / KerML files
- LSP providers: inlay hints, call/type hierarchy, signature help, code lens, document links, workspace symbols, linked editing, selection ranges, code actions, formatting
- Keyword validation with "did you mean?" suggestions
- npm package, Python LSP client, background parse worker
- `make update-library`, `make package-server`, `make test-package`

### Changed
