# Changelog

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- Mermaid diagram preview: SysML → Mermaid diagram generation with 6 diagram types (class, activity, state, sequence, interconnection, use-case) and auto-detection
- Mermaid focus mode: filter diagram to a specific element, its children, parent, and related types
- Mermaid diff mode: compare original vs. modified SysML and report structural changes
- Complexity analyzer: structural complexity metrics (nesting depth, coupling, fan-out, documentation coverage) with composite 0–100 index and per-definition hotspots
- Semantic validator: unresolved type references, invalid multiplicity bounds, empty enumerations, duplicate definitions — with standard-library type allow-list
- MCP tool `preview`: generates Mermaid diagrams from SysML with focus/diff support
- MCP tool `getDiagnostics`: returns semantic diagnostics for parsed documents
- MCP tool `getComplexity`: exposes complexity analysis as an MCP tool
- Code action quick-fixes: naming convention (PascalCase/camelCase), missing documentation stub, empty enumeration placeholder, unused definition suppression
- Library type-level indexing: Go-to-Definition into standard library types at exact declaration lines
- Multiplicity extraction from parse tree (`0..*`, `1`, etc.) on symbols
- Documentation extraction from doc/comment nodes on symbols
- Symbol table caching per URI keyed by document version
- Multi-specialization support: comma-separated specialization targets with `:>` and `specializes`
- LSP `sysml/serverStats` request: uptime, memory, and cache statistics
- LSP `sysml/clearCache` request: flush all in-memory caches
- LSP `sysml/status` notifications: begin/end parse progress events
- Language configuration: folding markers (`#region`/`#endregion`), indentation rules, `wordPattern`
- Model stats: lex/parse timing breakdown and complexity report in `sysml/model` response
- New tests: codeActions, complexity, libraryIndex, semantic validation, MCP preview/diagnostics

### Changed

- MCP `validate` response shape: now returns `syntaxErrors`, `semanticIssues`, and `totalIssues` (was `errors` + `errorCount`)
- Symbol `typeName` → `typeNames` (array) across MCP core and model provider
- Definition provider simplified: word-at-position logic moved inline
- References provider: uses symbol-table–based `findReferences()` instead of cross-file text scanning
- Diagnostics computed synchronously on document change (removed background parse worker thread)
- Symbol table kind inference: direct string comparison replaces regex-based rule matching for minification safety
- Document manager simplified: removed `TextDocuments` integration; parse timing now derived from `ParseResult.timing`
- esbuild: output format changed from ESM (`.mjs`) to CJS (`.js`); simplified to server + MCP + client bundles
- Parser simplified: removed SLL/LL two-stage fallback with `BailErrorStrategy`; single-pass parse
- MCP server: added `instructions` field for tool-call guidance
- Library index: `resolveLibraryPackage()` replaced by `resolveLibraryType()` for type-level lookups

### Removed

- Background parse worker thread (`parseWorker.mjs`) and DFA warm-up
- `resolveAt()` and `getWordAtPosition()` from symbol table (moved to providers)
- `findTextReferences()` text-scanning reference finder
- Keyword typo validation from diagnostics provider (replaced by semantic validator)
- Several parser and symbol table tests (connection-end parsing, keyword typo, `findTextReferences`)

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- Custom LSP request (`sysml/model`): full semantic model with scoped queries
- MCP server (`sysml-mcp` CLI): 7 tools, 3 resources, 3 prompts for AI-assisted modelling
- Standard library: 94 bundled SysML v2 / KerML files from OMG release repo
- Inlay hints: ghost text for inferred types and supertypes
- Call hierarchy: action call graph navigation
- Type hierarchy: specialization chain navigation
- Signature help: parameter tooltips for action/calc invocations
- Code lens: reference counts above definitions
- Document links: clickable `import` statements
- Workspace symbols: cross-document symbol search
- Linked editing ranges: simultaneous rename of all occurrences
- Selection ranges: smart expand/shrink selection
- Code actions: quick-fix actions for diagnostics
- Formatting: document and range formatting
- Keyword validation: typo detection with "did you mean?" suggestions
- npm package: `sysml-v2-lsp` distributable for third-party extensions
- Python LSP client: reference JSON-RPC/stdio client
- Parse worker: background ANTLR parsing with DFA warm-up
- `make update-library`: fetch latest standard library from upstream
- `make package-server` / `make test-package`: npm tarball build and validation

### Changed

- Go-to-definition falls back to standard library for unresolved symbols
- Recursive type name extraction in symbol table
- Synthetic `start`/`done` nodes in activity diagram flows
- Element kind enum expanded to 55 kinds
- esbuild bundles four targets: server, worker, MCP server, VS Code client
